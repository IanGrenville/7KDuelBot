# 7KDuelBot
Automatically runs duels for /r/SevenKingdoms

To use the bot, simply post a comment in the form:

\<Dueler Name 1> \<Bonus> \<Yield Threshold>
  
\<Dueler Name 2> \<Bonus> \<Yield Threshold>

Dramatic Mode(Optional)
  
/u/7KDuelBot

Including the phrase "Dramatic Mode" will cause the rounds to be posted as a chain of comments, seperated about a minute apart to give people time to react.

Duelbot uses Python 3.7 and the PRAW library.

To use your own version of this, you will need to make a new bot account and set it up for running a reddit bot, then put that info in a praw.ini file.

PRAW can be found here: https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
